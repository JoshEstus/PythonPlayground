# Employee CRUD App
Trying out Tkinter making an Employee CRUD App. Used a db connection and meant to be a local experiment and test. 

Its assumed the following commands have already been ran
```
CREATE DATABASE employee;

CREATE TABLE emp_details(emp_id int PRIMARY KEY, emp_name varchar(100), emp_dept varchar(100));
```
